# Web-Chat-App
As part of this project, I created a webRTC app that implements the audio/video communication between two or more users. I used javascript APIâ€™s such as getUserMedia, RTCpeerconnection, RTCdataconnection to achieve the functionalities. Node.js server was used to host the application 

Steps to be followed:
1) Install Node.js.
2) Go to the folder in the Node.js command prompt.
    eg) cd C:\Users\Dhananjayan\Desktop\EE284proj-Web Chat App
    
3) Start the Node.Js server to host the files
    eg) node index.js
    
4) Go to the url http://localhost:8080/start.html in the browser to access the app.
